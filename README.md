-- PICKAGAME PROJECT --
Welcome to the "PICKAGAME" project's github!

This project revolves around the usage of Steam's API, and is meant to help people find new games,
or for those who have expansive libraries, play games they haven't thought of in a while!

The frontend side's technologies feature Framer Motion for page transitions, and is entirely built
using the React framework, and was set up using vite and npm.

The backend is here: https://github.com/SDreadnoug2/game-picker-backend

Speaking of user interaction, this will be my first introduction to the implementation of openID, which will be utilized to speed up users' access to their library, without having to share their password with gamepicker.

The site is currently being hosted at both:

https://www.pickagame.app
-- OR --
https://pickagame.app

If you would like to set up this project for yourself please follow these instructions:

1. Via git, clone the repository (i.e. git clone https://github.com/SDreadnoug2/game-picker-frontend/)
2. inside of the downloaded repo, install the necessary packages using npm install
3. For building, simply run npm run build, the created dist folder can then be used to rehost the site!

NOTE
If you would just like to run the project in browser without building, the script npm run dev
can also be run to launch the app on a local host.

Please let me know if there's any way I could enhance this project, and feel free to fork :)
